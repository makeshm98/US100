# HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Example Working

The **HC-SR04** is a popular digital ultrasonic sensor used for measuring distances. It works by sending an ultrasonic pulse and calculating the time it takes for the pulse to bounce back from an object (echo). Based on the time taken, it calculates the distance between the sensor and the object.

## Key Components:
1. **Trigger Pin**: Used to send out an ultrasonic pulse.
2. **Echo Pin**: Used to receive the reflected pulse (echo).
3. **Ultrasonic Transmitter**: Sends out the ultrasonic pulse.
4. **Ultrasonic Receiver**: Receives the reflected pulse.

## Working Principle:
1. The sensor sends out an ultrasonic pulse at **40 kHz** via the **trigger pin**.
2. The pulse travels through the air, hits an object, and reflects back to the sensor.
3. The **echo pin** receives the reflected pulse.
4. The time between sending the pulse and receiving the echo is measured.
5. Using the speed of sound in air (~343 m/s), the distance is calculated.

## Formula:
Distance (cm) = (Time (µs) * 0.0343) / 2

# How Digital Sensors Like HC-SR04 Measure Distance Using Binary Format

Yes, in digital sensors like the **HC-SR04**, the time difference between the transmitted and received signals is used to calculate the distance of an object. Here's how the process works in a **binary format** at the **echo pin**:

## Working of the Echo Pin:
- The **echo pin** of the sensor outputs a **binary digital signal** — either **HIGH (1)** or **LOW (0)**.
- When an ultrasonic pulse is transmitted, the echo pin stays **LOW (0)**.
- Once the sensor receives the reflected pulse (echo), the echo pin goes **HIGH (1)** and stays HIGH for a duration that corresponds to the time taken by the pulse to travel to the object and back.
- After the echo is processed, the echo pin returns to **LOW (0)**.

## Binary Timing in the Echo Pin:
1. **HIGH Pulse**:  
   The echo pin generates a **HIGH (1)** signal for a specific duration (in microseconds). The length of this HIGH pulse is proportional to the distance to the object.

2. **LOW Pulse**:  
   The echo pin returns to **LOW (0)** once the echo is received and the measurement is done.

## How the Measurement is Taken in Digital Format:
- The **HIGH and LOW** states of the echo pin form a **pulse** whose **duration** is measured in microseconds.
- In an Arduino or other microcontroller, the `pulseIn()` function is used to measure this time duration. Here's what happens:
    - The `pulseIn()` function measures how long the echo pin remains **HIGH (1)** (this is the time between the transmission and reception of the ultrasonic pulse).
    - The time duration is a digital number (a series of 1s and 0s representing the length of the pulse in binary form) which is then used to calculate the distance.

## Binary Data Representation:
- Even though the echo pin generates a **digital pulse**, the Arduino or microcontroller reads the duration of the HIGH pulse and converts this into a **binary number**. 
    - For example, if the echo pin remains HIGH for 1456 microseconds, this duration is represented as a binary value inside the microcontroller.
    - This binary number is then used in calculations (like multiplying by the speed of sound) to get the final distance value in centimeters or inches.

## Summary of Digital Format (Binary):
- The echo pin provides a **digital (binary)** output, which is a pulse duration in terms of HIGH (1) and LOW (0) signals.
- The **length of the HIGH state** (measured in microseconds) is proportional to the distance of the object.
- This time duration is represented as a **binary value** (series of 1s and 0s) inside the microcontroller and is used in the distance calculation formula.

## Example:
- The pulse might be **HIGH (1)** for **1000 µs** for an object that is relatively close.
- The time (1000 µs) is internally represented as a binary number in the microcontroller (1000 in binary is `1111101000`).
- This time is then multiplied by the speed of sound to calculate the distance.

In conclusion, the **echo pin** outputs a binary signal (HIGH or LOW) that represents the **duration** for which the pin is HIGH. This duration is measured in microseconds, processed as binary data by the microcontroller, and used to calculate the distance to the object.
